# OpenContentTemplates (Handlebars-based__) for OpenContent on DNN

These are templates that we commonly use for various projects.

Learn more about DNN CMS at [the official DNN community website](https://dncommunity.org).

## How To Use These Templates

1. Be sure you have [DNN installed](https://dnncommunity.org/How-To/Download-and-Install) with [the latest version of OpenContent](https://opencontent.readme.io/) installed as well.
2. Have an OpenContent module added to any page.
3. Go into Edit Mode in DNN with a superuser account.  
4. Choose `Edit Global Settings` from the actions menu (one of the last menu items).
5. Find the `Github Templates Repository` setting.
6. Now, copy/paste the following value:  `,UpendoVentures/OpenContentTemplates`.  (Leave out the period, but include the comma.)
7. Save your update.

Now, when you choose to create a new template, all of these templates are available in addition to any others you might already have on your site.
